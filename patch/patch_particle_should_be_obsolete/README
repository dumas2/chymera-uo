CHYMERA 2.0.0

Code organization:

* bin: makefiles. Will contain object files when compiled.
* eos: state.f and initialization of H2 tables.
* fluid: fluid tracing routines.
* headers: *.h header files. *.h.orig include distribution values.
* legacy: Where old code goes.
* patch: Modification and extenals directory. USE THIS DIRECTORY to
	modify source code.  Do NOT modify source code in other
	directories, except for the header files. At compilation,
	files are first searched for in the patch directory. 
	The file passive.f is included in the patch directory because
	it will need to modified according to the user's needs. 
	The file format for saving data should NOT be changed, just
	the initialization of the arrays.
* pot: Potential solver files, including external potential.
* radhydro: Hydrodynamics and radiation routines.  Including ad hoc
	cooling routines.     
* run: Data files and suggested directory for running simulations.
	The executable is installed in this directory upon compiliation
	as a default.

Compilation:

* See COMPILE in bin for details.

What's new?

* Enter a rotating reference frame
* Passively fluxed arrays
* More tractable handling of fluid routines
* More tractable handling of stellar potential. In principle, any
	external potential can now be added by modifing pot/ExternalPot.f.
* Softened potential for star: jmin=2 can be used for disk simulations
* Modified output to log files.  Relevant information is now dumped,
	as well as time stamps.
* Precision control: Digits 0-10 are now stored as double precision 
	constants.  In addition, 0.5d0=half, 0.25d0 = quarter, and
	twothree=2d0/3d0.  The code has not been completely updated,
	but the framework is now in place for future code modifications.
* Explicit version numbering

NEW IN VERSION 2.1.0 (3 March 2009)

* New accretion mechanism.  See ExternalRoutines
* New cooling prescription as described in Boley (2009). See ExternalRoutines
* Rolled back implicit handling due to parallelization problems. Code will need to
	be rewritten in order to incorporate implicit or semi-implicit cooling/heating.
	Explicit once again.

BUGS

* Major caching problems with index ordering have been identified and corrected.
	Some places may still have caching problems.  These will be slowly corrected
	with subversions, e.g., 2.0.0 to 2.0.1.
* Error in array size declaration in pot3.f WAW was too small to account for KMAX>32.
* Some minor parallelization problems.

UPDATE

2.0.1:
* Corrected error with call to wiggle.  Missing gsoft in call.

2.0.2:
* Added semi-implicit step for heating and cooling.  This removes the dependency on limiters.
  The addition is set by a pre-compiler definition NOLIMIT.  Just define it (default) to use
  no limiters.
* Corrected hardcoded numbers to parameters in wiggle.F
* VINVH was added to the common block as VINH in flux.f.  Because this routine uses implicit
  declaration, no error was discovered.  The code was OK because a save statement was used
  for VINVH, which took the place of the common block.  VINVH is now back with the common block
  for consistency.

2.1.0

* Rolled back implicit handling due to parallelization problems. Code will need to
        be rewritten in order to incorporate implicit or semi-implicit cooling/heating.
        Explicit once again.
NEW BUGS

* Softening incorrectly called in 3dhyd-main.  Fixed.
* Tested integration scheme of star extensively.  Works well provided that the
  	mass accretion through the inner boundary is extremely small. Use 
	softening to for this.
