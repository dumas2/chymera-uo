THE DATA AREIN THIS ORDER:
PINDEX, GAMMA, KONST
ITSTRT,ITSTOP,IDIAG,ISOADL,ITYPE,NMODL,ISTOR,IGRID, 
NPRIME (=9 for ISO)

ISOADL=1, ISOTHERMAL; =2, POLYTROPIC; =3, ENERGY EQUATION

ITYPE=1-4 RESTARTED UNFORMATTED  MODELS

1 MEANS READ MODEL FROM UNFORMATTED RESTART FILE
2 MEANS READ MODEL FROM UNFORMATTED RESTART FILE AND
                         INCREASE R GRID SIZE
3 MEANS READ MODEL FROM UNFORMATTED RESTART FILE AND
                         INCREASE Z GRID SIZE
4 MEANS READ MODEL FROM UNFORMATTED RESTART FILE AND
                         INCREASE RZ GRID SIZE

ITYPE=5-7 INITIAL HACHISU MODEL PLUS PERTURBATION

5 MEANS READ MODEL CREATED BY HACHISU CODE, NO PERTURBATION
6 MEANS READ MODEL CREATED BY HACHISU CODE AND PERTURB IT WITH
              MACLAURIN BAR MODE 
7 MEANS READ MODEL CREATED BY HACHISU CODE AND PERTURB IT WITH
	      RANDOM PERTURBATION.

ITYPE GE 8 INITIAL MODEL FROM ANOTHER MACHINE PLUS PERTURBATION

8 START DATA FROM FORMATTED DATA SET GENERATED ON ANOTHER MACHINE
9 START DATA FROM AXISYMMETRIC  FORMATTED DATA SET GENERATED ON
                         ANOTHER MACHINE; no perturbation
96 START DATA FROM AXISYMMETRIC  FORMATTED DATA SET GENERATED ON
           ANOTHER MACHINE AND PERTURB IT WITH A MACLAURIN BAR MODE 
97 START DATA FROM AXISYMMETRIC  FORMATTED DATA SET GENERATED ON
           ANOTHER MACHINE AND PERTURB IT WITH RANDOM PERTURBATION
98 RESTART FROM UNFORMATTED RESTART FILE AND ADD RANDOM PERTUBATION
