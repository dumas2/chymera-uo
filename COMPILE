Compile in the bin directory using make. 
If all desired preprocessor switches are set, all one needs
to do is type make in the bin directory.  Makefile is the main driver, and Makefile.*
indicates the compiler of choice, where * is the desired compiler
or computer.  Makefile should not need to be changed, but the
compiler specific files may require minor adjustments to suit
the user's needs. Makefile.DEFS contains default settings for
precompiler switches. These include the following:

 MAKEFILE= desired system/compiler
 EXEDIR= placement of executable. Default ../run
 WIGGLE= integrate star
 WIGGLE_RESTART= restart star and integrate
 FLUID= integrate fluid elements
 FLUID_RESTART= restart and integrate fluid elements
 PASSIVE= number of passively fluxed arrays. Zero shuts it off.
 PASSIVE_INIT= initialize passive
 VERBOSE= few implementations at the moment. Will be expanded
 EXTERNAL_POT= include external potential source, e.g., the star
 EXTERNALS= include external routines. Source code should go in patch.
 BINARY= Turn on a binary potential. The default is a Roche potential
 INDIRECT= Use an indirect potential.  This should be used instead of Wiggle, but feel
           free to use Wiggle if a direct integration is needed
 PARTICLE= Turn on particles

Use a 0 to set a value to false, and 1 or larger to activate, unless
a directory is desired. Note that you may see MAKEFILE?= blah in
Makefile.DEFS.  Do not change these values; this checks to see whether
an option is defined.  If it is not, it takes on the value blah. 
Values can also be changed on the command line.  For example,

 make MAKEFILE=Makefile.columbia WIGGLE=1 FLUID=1 PASSIVE=2

will use options suitable for Columbia, integrate the star and
fluid elements, and follow two passive arrays.

Directories in the Makefile are relative to the bin directory.
