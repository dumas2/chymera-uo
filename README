* COMPILE contains information on compiling the code.
* VERSION discusses some of the code's structure, capabilities, and updates over time.

* THIS README FILE contains a quick HOW-TO for running the code.  

o Quick basics:

  * The main arrays over the computational volume are given ordered
    ARRAY(JMAX2,KMAX2,LMAX) for JMAX=Max R zones, KMAX= Max Z zones
    and LMAX=Max azimuthal zones.  JMAX2=JMAX+2, etc., which takes 
    into account ghost cells.  J=2 is the first radial cell and 
    JMAX1 (JMAX+1) is the last radial cell on the computational volume.
    J=1 and JMAX2 are boundary ghost cells.  Likewise for K. 

  * S = radial momentum density
  * T = vertical momentum density
  * A = angular momentum density
  * rho = mass volume density
  * eps = internal energy volume density

  * S,T are face-centered. A,rho,eps are all cell-centered.

  * U,W,OMEGA are the radial, vertical, and azimuthal velocity components,
    where OMEGA is the azimuthal speed. They have the same centering as the
    corresponding momenta.

  * R,Z = face-zeroed quantities.  R(2) = 0, and R(3) = rof3n, where rof3n
    and zof3n are the radial and vertical cell sizes. 

  * rhf and zhf are the cell-centered radial and vertical quantities.  
    rhf(2)= half*rof3n

  * Loops are ordered L,K,J.  J is the fastest iterator as a result, which
    is optimal for FORTRAN arrays (column-major).

  * Source gives force and dissipation/cooling terms.

  * Flux takes care of the advective terms.

  * Evolution: 1/2 source -> 1/2 Flux -> full Flux with updated values 
     -> Potential update -> 1/2 source with updated values.

o The header files, along with pre-compiler options, control the functionality of the code.
  
  * units.h contains the cooling switches, equation of state options, data files names,
    and definitions of constants.  

  * globals.h declares global variables and common blocks.  In an updated version of the code,
    modules will be used instead.  For now, common blocks will need to suffice.

  * hydroparams.h contains the size of the arrays, defining JMAX,KMAX, and LMAX.  POT3JMAX and
    POT3KMAX are also defined for the potential solver.  The potential grid need not be the 
    same size as the rest of the grid, but it cannot be smaller than JMAX,KMAX.  Usually, they
    are set to the same size.  A large potential volume may be desired for some problems to
    minimize boundary value problems.  JMIN sets the inner boundary of the system. If JMIN=2,
    the entire grid is active.  For JMIN>2, radii with J<JMIN are not included in the calculation.
    Any mass that flows through the inner grid is either added to the central potential or 
    simply discarded. The default is to assume a central potential is used and to add that mass
    to the potential. The rest of the values in hydroparams.h should not be changed.


o Upon compiling the code, the executable (default 'chymera-omp') will be in the run directory.
  This directory also contains all dat files for table reads, and will need to contain the 
  files fort.5 and fort.7.  

  * fort.5 is the basic readin file. It controls the code output and simulation steps. This
    will be changed to a user-friendly namelist readin formation, but as of now, we need to 
    deal with an input file based on coding during code antiquity. The top of the file is 
    shown below.

NPRIME (=9 for ISO)

### END CODE ###

    Some description is given in the fort.5 file.  The main things to note are the following:
      o KCONST (p=KCONST rho^(1+1/n)) and the polytropic index n.   
      o GAMMA = 1+1/n = adiabatic index
      o Iteration start, iteration stop, diagnostic output, ISOADL=3 (do not change), 
        initial model type, NMODL=1 (do not change), output store, IGRID=0 (do not change).
      o Last line is obsolete, but keep it in until the readin has been updated. Do not change.

    Iteration start is the first iteration the code will take, and the stop is the last iteration.
    This is just for any given stretch.  Diagnostic writes will be made every IDIAG, including
    density and temperature dumps.  Restart files and very large files for complete diagnostics 
    will be dumped every ISTOR.  Be careful with the selection of ISTOR, as too frequent dumps
    can lead to excessive data demands.

    ITYPE describes the model readin.  ITYPE=1 is used for a restart without any modification. 
    ITYPE=98 reads in the file, but then adds a random density perturbation with an amplitude
    given by amp0 set in units.h (headers directory). ITYPE=99 reads in an LMAX=8 model and 
    expands it to the LMAX given in hydroparams.h.

  * fort.7 is the restart file.  Output from the code saved.* can be copied to fort.7 as a new
    readin.  When the input controls are converted to namelist files, the user will have the
    option of giving a name for the restart file to avoid the copying hastle.  Copying is in 
    place for now, though.

o ANALYSIS DIRECTORY

  * A variety of analysis tools are available for streamlining images and movie production. All
    fortran code can usually be compiled with gfortran -o blah blah.f90 -frecord-marker=4.
    Be sure to mind the endianness, as well as what the compiler is actually doing with record
    marker length.
      o sigplot.f90 makes surface density plots from code output.  Run ./sigplot to get instructions
        how to run the code. For example:

### TERMINAL SESSION ###

        For AU units, i.e., the default with G=1, AU=1, and Msun=1, torp = 0.159 to convert code
        output to years. Any value can be given for torp, for example, the ORP conversion.
        dz = cell-to-size unit conversion for AU units, but could be different for other units.
        The code will work in log units and give output in surface density cgs log10.  For min
        surface density, give a small number in log10 (e.g., -18.).  For AU units, cgs surfden 
        conversion is about 8.9e6.  Filein should be a rho3d file. An example of correct syntax is

        where the cell sizes are 0.1 AU. The output file sig.100000 will have X, Y, and 
        V, where V is log10(surface density).  These can be plotted with python scripts
        or most simply with gunplot

### GNUPLOT SESSION ###

gnuplot>f="sig.100000"

### END GNUPLOT ###

        Many files can be made at once using makesig.sh. This is just a template, and may need some
        modification for limits, etc., for any given use.  makeimage.py is likely more understandable,
        but makesig.sh works with just gnuplot and tcsh.

      * midplot.f90 plots midplane density or temperature values, and is used analogously to sigplot.f90.  
        Many of the other tools follow similar patterns. The scale is linear for midplot.

      * Many other tools are available.  Many of them are given with the current distribution, but
        documentation is still being made.  When all else fails, look at the source code.  Most tools give
        some hint how to use them by running them without any command line input.

o Your first disk simulation.

      * Simulation ICs are available for users through github. For your first run, consider the ICs in
        CHYMERA-CODE-IC-1. Do the following, assuming PWD=$CHYMERA_HOME, where CHYMERA_HOME is the directory 
        where you can see bin, run, radhydro, etc. I'm also assuming the CHYMERA-CODE-IC-1 is available in 
        the $HOME directory, but this can be anywhere of the user's choosing.
          1). Copy $HOME/CHYMERA-CODE-IC-1/ic.dat to run/fort.7
          2). Copy $HOME/CHYMERA-CODE-IC-1/fort.5 to run/.
          3). Copy $HOME/CHYMERA-CODE-IC-1/units.h to headers/.
             -> Note that placing header files in the patch directory will not work at the moment. I'm
                aware fo the issue and working on it.
          4). Copy $HOME/CHYMERA-CODE-IC-1/hydroparam.h to headers/.
          5). Copy $HOME/CHYMERA-CODE-IC-1/Makefile.DEFS to bin/.
          6). cd bin
          7). make
             -> The code fort.7 file is binary, little endian.  If you have a big endian machine, before
                running the code type
                
                  export GFORTRAN_CONVERT_UNIT="little_endian"

                for bash.  

             -> If you are using a compiler other than gcc, adjustments will need to be made.

          8). cd ../run
          9). ./chymera-omp
          10). When finished, you will have files to analyze.
          11). cd ../analyze
          12). Make sure sigplot and midplot have been compiled.
          13). ./midplot 10 11 10 512 64 256 0.159 0.167 0.167 3. 1. ../run/temperat3d. tk_
          14). ./sigplot 10 11 10 512 64 256 0.159 0.167 0.167 -18. 8.9e6 ../run/rho3d. sig_ 
          15). python makeimage.py
          16). xv png/sig_000010.png
          17). Make edits in makeimage.py to analyze temperature next, and look at the tk image
               along with time sig image.

      * A few notes on image files:
          1). rslts.* contain lots of output regarding the simulation. It is in ascii format.
          2). gamma1.* contain the adiabatic index. This is only needed for variable gamma sims.
          3). coolheat_full.* big file containing output regarding heating terms and optical depths
          4). saved.* restart files.  
          5). massflow.* files tracking mass flow on and off the grid, as well as accretion onto a
              central object if used.
          6). rho3d.* volume density output
          7). temperat3d.* temperature output
          8). There are other files.  Some are uesful, others are not.  I am trying to clean this up.

      * Known issues
          1). Mind the stack size limits.  If the code has an immediate segfault, the stack size might
              be too small.  Increase using the commands "ulimit" in bash and "limit" in (t)csh.
