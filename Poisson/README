Programs
--------
pot3.F              - Original potential solver that Chymera uses. In its
                      current form, it calculates the solution and outputs
                      m=1 solution in Fourier space, as well as output to
                      boundary conditions.
poisson_solver.F90  - Main driver to replace Chymera for testing the potential
                      solver. 
poissonRelax.F90    - Driver for the relaxation routine.
pot32.F             - Modified potential solver that calls relaxation routine
                      instead of matrix solver.
boundary.F          - Generates boundary conditions.
defines_mod.F90     - 
multigrid.F90       - Contains relaxation and residual subroutines.
relaxMod.F90        - Modular form of poissonRelax, called in pot32.F
